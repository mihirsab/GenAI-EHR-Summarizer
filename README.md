# Health Pulse AI

## Introduction

According to a 2023 report by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, misdiagnosis is a significant issue, leading to 371,000 deaths and 424,000 permanent disabilities annually. In our team, we recognize the challenges in managing medical records, exacerbated by the complexity of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and the prevalence of paper records. This lack of accessibility and interoperability poses risks to patient safety and contributes to clinicians spending more time on administrative tasks than with patients.

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Complexity of EHRs
Health records are scattered across different EHRs, hindering a comprehensive view of a patient's health history. This complexity can lead to misdiagnoses due to incomplete information.

### 2. Lack of Patient-Friendly Records
Medical records often contain complex terminology, contributing to the low health literacy of 78% of US adults. This results in difficulties in understanding medical information, affecting adherence to preventive behaviors.

### 3. Clinician Time Management
Clinicians spend more time on EHR systems than with patients, limiting the quality of patient interactions. Streamlining administrative tasks can improve focus on patient care.
